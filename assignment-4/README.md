# Assignment 4: KNN and Naive Bayes

This assignment response implements two Python programs
that both work on a `weather_training.csv` file and a `weather_test.csv` file.

## KNN

The KNN program performs the following tasks:

1. Reads in the training and test files.
2. Parses float values as needed.
3. Discretizes the temperature column into a discrete set of classes.
4. Tests multiple values for KNN hyperparameters against the training and test data.
5. Prints out the best accuracy found in real-time.

## Naive Bayes

The Naive Bayes program performs the following tasks:

1. Reads in the training and test files.
2. Parses float values as needed.
3. Discretizes the temperature column into a discrete set of classes.
4. Tests out multiple smoothing values for the Naive Bayes classifier.
5. Prints out the best accuracy found in real-time.
